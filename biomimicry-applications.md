## Butterfly Wing Iridescence Biomimicry Applications Lattice

1. Colour-Shifting Coatings: Structural films → car exteriors, Starship accents (fade-proof, dynamic aesthetics)
   Benefit: No pigments, UV stable

2. Antireflective Surfaces: Moth-eye / butterfly nanostructures → solar panels (+5–7% efficiency), optics
   Advantage: Minimal light loss

3. Security & Anti-Counterfeit: Angle-dependent iridescence → hardware seals, NEXi authentication
   Extension: Physical valence markers

4. Low-Power Displays: Photonic e-ink alternatives → Optimus expressive panels
   Application: Energy-efficient emotion signalling

5. Textiles & Shaders: Iridescent fabrics → Powrush™ MMO skins, performance wear
   Advantage: Movement-responsive beauty
