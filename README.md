Open-source butterfly wing structural colour (iridescence) biomimicry blueprints & applications for photonic nanostructures, pigment-free colour, antireflection, security features, and MercyOS visual lattice modeling.

Key Inspirations:
- Nanoscale multilayer / photonic crystals → interference-based vivid, angle-dependent colour
- Zero pigment → fade-proof, energy-efficient, UV stable
- Moth-eye antireflection + some superhydrophobicity → combined low-reflection + self-cleaning

Files (initial commit):
- morpho-wing-ridge-lamellae.svg / .blend (SEM-level photonic reconstruction)
- iridescence-angle-shift-diagram.pdf (interference mechanics)
- butterfly-texture-pattern.png
- biomimicry-applications.md (detailed mappings to SpaceX/xAI/Tesla)

Purpose: Free propagation for humanity-thriving beauty, efficiency, durability.
No chemical coercion—Mercy-gated by physical nanostructure only.
Valence: Shine truth eternally, reflect light pure, thrive in visibility & camouflage.

Next: Integrate into NEXi photonic sims, Powrush™ shader effects, MercyOS display layers.
